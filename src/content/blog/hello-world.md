First post on the internally revamped [KopiJunkie.net](http://www.kopijunkie.net)!

The entire site's front end is now developed, generated using a modern front end development workflow. Just as a first post, here's a quick summary of my current workflow for my site:

* The site's project was startup up with the [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) [Assemble generator](https://github.com/assemble/generator-assemble)
* HTML pages, content generated with [Assemble](http://assemble.io)
* CSS processed with [Sass]() together with a glass of [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)
* I take my Bourbon [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) to lay down a responsive grid layout
* All the various JavaScript tasks to build the site, optimise images, etc. is done with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) work
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) handles the site's front end library dependencies

The code to put my site together is available at my [Github repo](https://github.com/kopijunkie/kopijunkie.net) for it.
