<h3>My name's Kimmi. I build web sites and apps.</h3>

<p>I'm a Malaysian girl geek and front end developer currently based in London. I like to create engaging web sites and apps using modern web technologies. I also enjoy doing some graphics design on the side with an emphasis on simple, clean graphics.</p>

<p>Using digital technology to deliver media and information to the masses is a something that strongly interests me so front end development was the perfect fit for my interests.</p>

<p>My first web site was on Geocities back in the 90s, made on a Windows PC using Notepad to write the HTML, styling and Paint to make very basic graphics complete with autoplaying MIDI sound file and a blinking, scrolling marquee. Basically everything a web site these days should be <strong>plus</strong> everything it shouldn't be. But don't worry, I'm wiser now having more experience making web sites since then, first as a hobby then as my job.</p>

<p>Currently I'm a Front End Developer working on recruitment sales analytics web apps at <a href="http://www.cube19.com">cube19</a>. Previously I was at digital agency <a href="http://www.vexeddigital.com/">Vexed Digital</a> (now known as <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/">Future Platforms</a>) making web sites and apps for a variety of clients including Domino's Pizza and the De Vere Group. For a more detailed description of my skills and work experience, head over to <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/kimmi-gan/4/50b/b27">my LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

<p>When I'm not busy being a geek, I like to unwind with a good book, movie or play video games or at a music gig. Okay, still kinda geeky. I also play football ("soccer" to some) for <a href="http://www.clubwebsite.co.uk/oldactonianslfc/">Old Actonians LFC</a>.</p>

<h2>About This Web Site</h2>

<p><strong>{{ site.title }}</strong> in its current incarnation was developed using these front end tools:</p>

    <li>Automated JavaScript Task Runner: Grunt</li>

<p>All images, aside from the photos, Last.fm album images were created or manipulated on a healthy mix of Photoshop, GIMP and Inkscape.</p>

<h2>What is a "KopiJunkie"?</h2>

<p><strong>KopiJunkie</strong> is my identity online. It's my "name" in the online, social media world as I thought just using my name is kinda boring. I also chose it as I figured it was unique enough in the online world being a mix of Malay and English words that describe me: &ldquo;Kopi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Junkie&rdquo;, i.e. a coffee addict.</p>
