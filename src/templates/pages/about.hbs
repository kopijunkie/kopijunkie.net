<h1>{{ heading }}</h1>

<p>My name's <strong>Kimmi</strong>. I build web sites and apps for desktops and mobile.</p>

<p>I like to create engaging web sites, apps with interesting user interfaces using modern web technologies. Having completed a Computer Science conversion course, I also do back end development now. I also enjoy doing some graphics razzle dazzle on the side.</p>

<p>My first web site was on Geocities back in the 90s, made on a Windows PC using Notepad to write the HTML, styling and Paint to make very basic graphics complete with autoplaying MIDI sound file and a blinking, scrolling marquee. Basically everything a web site should be <strong>plus</strong> everything it shouldn't be. But don't worry, I'm wiser now having more experience developing web sites since then, first as a hobby then as my day-to-day job. Definitely way past that phase now and I know better than to develop something tacky.</p>

<h2>About This Web Site</h2>

<p>{{site.title}} in its current incarnation was developed using front end technologies, specifically:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Static Site Generator: Assemble</li>
    <li>Automated JavaScript Task Runner: Grunt</li>
    <li>Front End Dependencies Manager: Bower</li>
    <li>CSS Preprocessor: Sass
        <ul>
            <li>Mixin Library: Bourbon</li>
            <li>Grid Framework: Neat</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>All images, aside from the social media icons, were created or manipulated on a healthy mix of <strong>Photoshop</strong>, <strong>GIMP</strong> and <strong>Inkscape</strong>.</p>


<h2>More About Me</h2>

<p>Still want to know more? I'm a Malaysian girl geek and front end developer currently based in London. I did a Computer Science masters degree at the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Bristol</a> and used to work in Singapore handling corporate events and conference services at a 5-star hotel until I decided that I wanted to build web sites for a living, not just as a hobby. Before my first working life, I studied at <a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/" target="_blank">Monash University</a>, Australia majoring in Mass Communication. (Yes, I've been around quite a bit!)</p>

<p>I have a strong interest in using digital technology to deliver media and information to the masses. Front end development is the perfect fit for my interest in bringing mass media (what I studied previously) and technology (my current skill set) together.</p>

<p>Right now I'm a Front End Developer working on a visual analytics web app product at <a href="http://www.cube19.com" target="_blank">cube19</a>. Previously I was at a digital agency, <a href="http://www.vexeddigital.com/" target="_blank">Vexed Digital</a> (now known as <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com/" target="_blank">Future Platforms</a>) making web sites and apps for a variety of clients including Domino's Pizza and the De Vere Group.</p>

<p>When I'm not busy being a geek, I like to kick back with a good book, comic, or movie or play video games. I also play football (or "soccer" to some) with Old Actonians LFC. While at university in Bristol, <a href="http://www.intuition-online.co.uk/profile.php?profile=205" target="_blank">a gig review I wrote</a> was published on <a href="http://www.intuition-online.co.uk/index.php" target="_blank">Intuition</a>, an online student lifestyle and culture magazine. These days I prefer to just enjoy a music gig rather than pick it apart for a review. Occasionally, I sketch stuff of a cartoon-ish nature for the fun of it like the "self caricature" pencil sketch.</p>
