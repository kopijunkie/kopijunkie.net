    <h2>Hi, there! My name's Kimmi and I'm a coffee junkie who loves building web sites and apps.</h2>

    <h3>Welcome to my home on the interwebz.</h3>

    <p>
    I'm a girl geek who loves to build web sites that aren't made up of tag soup, create user interfaces using modern web technologies. I also dabble with graphics design at times.
    </p>

    <p>
    Basically, I'm passionate about web technologies and have a keen interest in arts and social sciences topics alongside technology stuff. To me, web technologies are a way for arts and technology to come together to create cool user experiences online. <strong>KopiJunkie.net</strong> is both my personal website/portfolio and front end web technologies playground.
