<h1>KopiJunkie &#61; a coffee junkie who builds web sites and apps.</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my home on the interwebz.</h2>

<p>
    I'm a girl geek who loves to build web sites for desktops and mobiles using modern web technologies. Occasionally I do some graphics and user interface design too.
</p>

<p>
    Modern web technologies is a passion of mine along with arts and social science. Web technologies allow me to bring arts, social science and technology together to create engaging and informative story narratives and data visualisations as well as an enjoyable and equally engaging user experience. <strong>{{site.title}}</strong> is my personal web site, portfolio and front end technologies playground.
